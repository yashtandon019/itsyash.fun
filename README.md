This is my personal website created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The website is designed to showcase my personal projects and professional experience.

### Installation

To run this website locally, you will need to have Hugo installed on your computer. Follow the [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/) on the Hugo website for your specific operating system.

### Usage

To start the website on your local machine, navigate to the root directory of the website in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
hugo serve
```

This will start a local development server at <http://localhost:1313/>, where you can view the website in your browser.

### Deployment

To deploy the website, you will need to generate the static files using the following command:

```bash
hugo
```

This will generate the static files in the `public/` directory. You can then upload these files to your web host.
